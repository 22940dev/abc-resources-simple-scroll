# resources
I'm borrowing a lot from github docs for this writeup


Fork this repository with the Fork button on top right of screen

You should now have a copy under your name ie yourname/resources

Create a local clone of your fork:
Navigate to your fork of the project
Select the dropdown on the green clone or download button and copy the url
